            <!-- <p>A simple yet effective single page layout to launch Ellen's business as as self employed physiotherapist in the South West London area. Ellen had some initial ideas so this made the design phase quite quick. The logo was done from her original ideas that I have adapted, and we have also created business cards to go with the website. I used a pure ruby application using sinatra for this small site to make it fast and easy to develop.</p> -->

            <p>"I needed someone capable of understanding me and the special needs I had for my business. Coming from a graphic print background, I had the skills to create the basic look of the website, but didn’t know how to translate it into a good online experience. Matt did great in guiding me and coping with the many little changes I requested. I’m very happy with the result!"</p>

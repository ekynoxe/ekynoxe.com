After I had successfully completed my first two super-sprint and sprint triathlons at Eton and London, 2 years ago, I remember the excitement and the butterflies in my stomach while pressing the 'register' button for the London triathlon Olympic distance event a year later. I was hooked.

*Well... I've done it again!*

Except this time, I'll go much, much longer. Yes, I registered for an ironman distance event! And you can now mark in your agendas that you have to come down enjoy the sun of Barcelona while cheering me along the flat and fast course of the Challenge Barcelona on the 2nd October 2011.

It seems far away, being a tad under 11 months from now, but for this kind of race, I want to be ready and not leave anything to the last minute. As the entries for these events go like hot cakes, and after much pointless discussions with many people, including athletes in the field, about whether or not do this particular event, I decided to go for it, take my ticket and not wait for anyone else to maybe come along with me. It's late enough for me to get ready, and I'm not after a world champ slot!

So let's be straight to the point: I am competitive etc... But I just want to finish this one. It's not about any qualification to word champs or anything like this as some have suggested, it's about surpassing myself, about finding masochistically some joy in the pain of a very long event and above all, it's about me, me and only me. I am entering next year the extremely competitive age-group of 30-34 year old males, and to be honest, I have absolutely no pretensions of doing any high results. Races in this age group are won under 9h! I'm aiming for 12.

What will I do during 12h? Well, it's dead simple: swim 3.8K, cycle 180Km, and run a marathon.

I don't believe that racing in a Challenge series event rather than an ironman branded event changes anything to its toughness, its appeal, or its glory at the finish line.

Some call me nuts, I call myself a committed addict.
No it's not a dare or a bet. It's just time.

See you in Barcelona!

Sometimes you are requested to do a quick job at work, that &#8220;should not last longer than 2/3 days&#8221;.

We&#8217;ve all been there, all done it and in my case in R&D with Orange, seen too many times the &#8220;project&#8221; end up in a drawer somewhere.

However, this time, I have been assigned on that &#8220;little project&#8221; called snapshot, for which the goal was simple: our team racing designer was creating the graphical design and I was translating that into XHTML/CSS as well as XHTML-MP templates for mobiles as quickly as I could

<div class='gallery'>
    <dl class='gallery-item'>
        <dt class='gallery-icon attachement'>
          <a href="http://blog.ekynoxe.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/snapshot-mob.jpg" rel="lightbox[136]" title="snapshot-mobile"><img src="http://blog.ekynoxe.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/snapshot-mob-93x300.jpg" alt="snapshot-mobile" /><span>The mobile interface</span></a>
        </dt>
    </dl>
    <dl class='gallery-item'>
        <dt class='gallery-icon attachement'><a href="http://blog.ekynoxe.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/snapshot.jpg" rel="lightbox[136]" title="snapshot"><img src="http://blog.ekynoxe.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/snapshot-300x225.jpg" alt="snapshot" /><span>The website</span></a>
        </dt>
    </dl>
</div>

As you&#8217;d expect from super quick things like these (mind you I was already assigned 100% on two other high profile projects before that came on), we had to cut corners. For example, there is no support for older browsers like IE6 for the moment. No time to work on that unfortunately, but it should not be too difficult to adapt the templates and CSS and found yet again a hacky way around double margins, wrong positioning and lack of png support.

Integration was quick with the dev team, although not super smooth, but for once it was going to make it as a product! It&#8217;s now all on <http://snapshot.orange.co.uk> and it&#8217;s [official][1]

Some features might be added sooner or later to the site, but hopefully it will be kept simple!

From initial feedback, it seems the most wanted feature is the ability to rotate the pictures, and it will be done soon!

So for one of the very few R&D projects I worked on that actually made it to the market and I can showcase, it&#8217;s celebration day!

I read something quite alarming yesterday in the editor's column of the September edition of the <a title="The Richmond and Barnes Magazine" href="http://www.sheengate.co.uk/richmond-and-barnes/">Richmond and Barnes magazine</a>. Richard Nye (<a title="therichmondmag on twitter" href="https://twitter.com/therichmondmag">@TheRichmondMag on twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Sheengate" title="The Richmond Magazine / Sheen Gate on facebook">The Richmond Magazine / Sheen Gate on facebook</a>) seems to think cyclists are a nuisance, and they should be dead.

Quoted straight from the editorial section of te September issue of the Richmond Magazine:

> [...] as a daily driver on busy roads, I tend towards the temperate view that the only good cyclist is a dead one [...]

The rest of the editorial is also worth a read. Appalling views.

<p class="attachement"><a href="{{ "Richmon_Mag_Sept2012_Editorial.png" | image_path | cdn }}" title="Richmond Magazine September 2012 Editorial" rel="lightbox[1344]"><img src="{{ "Richmon_Mag_Sept2012_Editorial_r500.png" | image_path | cdn }}" alt="Richmond Magazine September 2012 Editorial" /><span>Richmond Magazine September 2012 Editorial</span></a></p>

The full editorial is available on <a title="The Richmond Magazine - September 2012 issue" href="http://edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/launch.aspx?referral=other&pnum=&refresh=3c0AN8r17o0P&EID=13e8b0cc-cddf-41cf-b28f-a505ca1b3a6c&skip=">page 11 of the swanky animated online edition</a>, but if it gets magically removed for whatever reason, here's a copy of <a title="Pages 1 and 11 of the September issue if the Richmond Magazine" href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5749425/richmondmag/Richmond_mag_September2012_pages1-11.pdf">page 11</a>, and of the <a title="Full September issue if the Richmond Magazine" href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5749425/richmondmag/Richmond_mag_September2012_full.pdf">full September edition</a>.

If you're a business who's advertised in this magazine, and especially if you're a sports related one (Virgin Active, or Moore's Cycles are in there), I urge you to consider removing your ads from a magazine who's editor clearly thinks your clients should be dead...

Nothing more to add.

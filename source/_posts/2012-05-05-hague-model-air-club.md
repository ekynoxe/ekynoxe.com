After 8 years under the previous design and code, a complete overhaul of the HMAC site was needed. It was cumbersome and slow to update, while the design was outdated. I've migrated it all on wordpress for the easiness of management, and redesigned the interface completely. It's also adaptive and should work on most browsers, including mobiles.

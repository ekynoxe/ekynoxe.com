I left home at 7:50am, hoping to be in Hammersmith for 9am.

But that was without thinking that yet again, buses (specifically the R68) come whent they want (in this case I waited 30min in the pouring rain), and that because of the rain, absolutely EVERYONE-NEEDED-THEIR-F\***-CARS.

So from Teddington, to Richmond tube station, which is less than 5km distance by car, took me 1h10min. Add to this waiting for the tube to go and I was in Hammersmith at 9:35, which makes this journey another record 1h45min for something I'd do in 35min on a bike.

Anymore excuses NOT to cycle??

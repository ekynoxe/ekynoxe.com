Today is the day everything gets set and ready for tomorrow! Race briefing, bike setup, but also getting Ellen to do a triathlon of her own!

<!--more-->

Waking up this morning brought a sense of relief for both of us. Today is the day before the big race for me, and Ellen was going to do a triathlon herself. All set, or almost, and not much to worry about anymore. We're at the end (or start, as I prefer) of a long journey!
We went to the beach, where I'll start tomorrow, and she went off for roughly a 1.8K swim while I went to the other side to set up her transition. It was already warm I'm the sunshine, but the sea was still very calm and in no time she was out of the water an on her way towards Matar√≥ for her bike turn! Duracell bunny will never cease to impress me :)
(I've got a little film too but for some reason, wordpress for iPhone crashes when I am trying to upload it, so it will come later!)

While she was out there battling the wind, I went for the race briefing and through the all important last panic buy at the expo. Expected mayhem in there, but I found what I needed and was finally ready for anything on the bike!

Ellen came back from her own triathlon before lunch while I was in preparation for the bike to figure out where everything would go. She had done 1.8K sea swim, 50K at almost 25kph average on her own and in the wind, and a 12 K run in 29C. Anyone to help me tell her she's doing so well? She seems not to want to hear it!!
After a spot of lunch, it was time for the bike checkin and transition racking. Gosh I will have not to get lost in there tomorrow!! This look empty right now!!

Ellen had fun with some helmets at the expo on our way back from transition... Errrrr, no darling, not this one!!

Now kit bags are ready for the race, everything should (hopefully) be in them, and nutrition is ready to be poured in bottles/prepared tomorrow morning!

That's it! No turning back! I can't believe I'm here or doing that thing, but I'm sure that whatever happens, I'm going to love it!!
Buena noche!!

Welcome to Calella de la Costa, 50Km north of Barcelona. It's hot, it's windy, and the roads are perfect. Bring on the race!

Leaving England and it's supposed "heatwave", going through BA desks in a breeze at the airport to get the bikes checked in, and we're ready for take off!

1h later and we're flying over the Pyrenees, almost straight over the places I've cycled with the club back in April. Geez these look sharp and steep! We've got over them back then! Tigger seems to approve!

Ellen and I we're then looking by the window to check if we could see from the plane the beach where the race will start from. But all we could see was that it was very windy!
Airport passed and bikes taken back without a problem, we're in a bus on our way to Calella. 1h something by bus to get there, easy and quick. Then hotel checkin!
The Sant Jordi Spa is 100m from the beach, there's a bike shop literally on the other side of the road and a supermarket for everything else 30m away (!!!!!). Perfect.

...

It's 28C outside, we've been to the spa pool, got relaxed after the day of travel. It's great before the race!

I was bored last winter. Turbo trainer and treadmill didn't cut it!
This year I decided I'd go play in the mud, and with this lovely entry level Boardman, I should be able to do just this!
I'm already registered to the [HumanRace Off-road winter series][1], which will hopefully break the monotony of road triathlon training!

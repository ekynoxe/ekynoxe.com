Although now what many would consider a proper geek, I've always been an engineer at heart, and I haven't forgotten my times in mechanical engineering. Watching this video is for me a fantastic highlight about manufacturing processes, all applied to one of the greatest inventions ever: the bicycle.

That was filmed in 1945 apparently, 60 odd years ago. Judging by the amount of workers and machinery in this British factory, the bike was then clearly the most convenient way to get around.

<blockquote>The bicycle is a comfortable and cheap way of getting about. A great boon to man, ideal for shopping, easy to park. And if at work, a faithful friend, ever ready to take tired workers back home, and after work, to bring relaxation, health and happiness.</blockquote>

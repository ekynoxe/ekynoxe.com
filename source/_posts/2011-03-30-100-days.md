&#8230; at betfair =) Â And unlike the many things that happened on <a href="http://blog.ivandemarino.me/2011/02/12/11-02-2011---It-happened-today" target="_blank">Ivan&#8217;s 100th day</a>, mine started quite quietly.

Well, that&#8217;s if you can call a 5:30am work day start quiet, but to some respect it is

*   It&#8217;s still pitch dark when I woke up, and only for a few birds singing here and there, there was no noise outside.
*   Cycling to work was the easiest, smoothest and fast I&#8217;ve ever done. Given the time, there was no one on the road and for a cyclist in London, that&#8217;s absolute bliss!!
*   No one on the office! I can put my music on and relax a bit while not having to cope with some others loud interactions and constant calls for attention.
*   I&#8217;ve been entrusted the responsibility to deploy content to the live production website of <a href="http://betfair.com" target="_blank">Betfair</a> and all went super smoothly in less than 15 minutes.
*   Light is coming through the bay windows, sun is going to rise soon over the Thames.

So far it&#8217;s been an incredible journey these last 100 days, both professionally and personally, and this just makes me happy.

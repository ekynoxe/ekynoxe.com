Here is a little song I wrote<br/>
You might want to sing it note for note<br/>
Don&#8217;t worry be happy<br/>
In every life we have some trouble<br/>
When you worry you make it double<br/>
Don&#8217;t worry, be happy&#8230;&#8230;<br/>

Ain&#8217;t got no place to lay your head<br/>
Somebody came and took your bed<br/>
Don&#8217;t worry, be happy<br/>
The land lord say your rent is late<br/>
He may have to litigate<br/>
Don&#8217;t worry, be happy<br/>
Lood at me I am happy<br/>
Don&#8217;t worry, be happy<br/>
Here I give you my phone number<br/>
When you worry call me<br/>
I make you happy<br/>
Don&#8217;t worry, be happy<br/>
Ain&#8217;t got no cash, ain&#8217;t got no style<br/>
Ain&#8217;t got not girl to make you smile<br/>
But don&#8217;t worry be happy<br/>
Cause when you worry<br/>
Your face will frown<br/>
And that will bring everybody down<br/>
So don&#8217;t worry, be happy (now)&#8230;..<br/>

There is this little song I wrote<br/>
I hope you learn it note for note<br/>
Like good little children<br/>
Don&#8217;t worry, be happy<br/>
Listen to what I say<br/>
In your life expect some trouble<br/>
But when you worry<br/>
You make it double<br/>
Don&#8217;t worry, be happy&#8230;&#8230;<br/>
Don&#8217;t worry don&#8217;t do it, be happy<br/>
Put a smile on your face<br/>
Don&#8217;t bring everybody down like this<br/>
Don&#8217;t worry, it will soon past<br/>
Whatever it is<br/>
Don&#8217;t worry, be happy<br/>

*Don&#8217;t Worry, Be Happy*<br/>

After a successful but simple first version of their site, <a title="New D3 triathlon website" href="http://d3triathlon.com/" target="_blank">D3 triathlon</a> needed something a little more refined and working across different devices. Augmented with new features for accessing race details quickly, this new version hopefully will bring D3 triathlon the audience they deserve!

<p class="attachement"><a href="{{ "d3.png" | image_path | cdn }}" title="D3 triathlon" rel="lightbox[892]"><img src="{{ "d3_r500.png" | image_path | cdn }}" alt="D3 triathlon" /></a></p>

Pay them a visit online, and if you&#8217;re in Ealing, go check them out directly! If you&#8217;re lookin to do some small and fun races, visit their site in a while when the new races are available. There should be for kids and adults!

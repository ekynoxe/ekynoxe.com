After a successful but simple first version of their site, <a title="New D3 triathlon website" href="http://d3triathlon.com/" target="_blank">D3 triathlon</a> needed something a little more refined and working across different devices. Augmented with new features for accessing race details quickly, this new version hopefully will bring D3 triathlon the audience they deserve!

Pay them a visit online, and if you&#8217;re in Ealing, go check them out directly! If you&#8217;re lookin to do some small and fun races, visit their site in a while when the new races are available. There should be for kids and adults!

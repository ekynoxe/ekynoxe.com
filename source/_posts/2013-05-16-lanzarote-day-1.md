First day on the island of fire! Back for some more after the 70.3 in November 2012.

I've left my other half at home. It's not nice. I don't like it, but it was always going to be like this and we knew it from day one. I won't be long now! Just a little race to do!

Packing was easy, it's a well oiled drill by now, although my dad suggested I packed the wrong bike when we exited the flat!

There's so much kit to take, yet I managed to get a light box and a light bag (25Kg and 10Kg) which is a first with me! What did I forget? Dad gets annoyed at all the 'new security crap' at the airport and that he has to throw away his brand new shower gel... I really thought that (A) he knew he couldn't take large tubs of liquids on-board, (B) he had NOT taken his toiletries with him in his carry-on, (C) he had flown since the 80s... No, no, and no! Chuckle at the airport while he's having a ball at criticising the lot. Yes dad, traveling by plane is a major annoyance, but it gets you there rather quickly.

The flight was easy and uneventful, except for the constantly crying kid on the next row. There really should be a family class added to planes! First, business, economy, and family. With lots of eggs boxes on the walls to cancel out crying baby noise!

Arriving in Lanzarote and it's not too hot (yay!), and we're at the hotel in a flash, despite the sat nav being so wrong. For the record, Puerto del Carmen is a gigantic one way system, and the map makers have no idea bout it! We reverted to the paper map from the car rental and eventually arrived at a nice flat from Arena Dorada. Thank you <a title="Sarah Bowen" href="https://twitter.com/SportsMassageSB">Sarah</a> for the hint! Jana says hello!

It's 19:30, we're starving, so the bike will wait after dinner to get built and tomorrow for a spin. Instead, I go for a quick dip in the hotel pool. Nice and fresh, long strokes, easy rhythm. Great after the travel to relax before dinner on the sea front. The little walk we do takes us on the final hundred meters of the run course, we identify the finish line, the transition zones etc, and look at the swim course for tomorrow morning. While it's not a mountainous run, it's definitely not flat. And I'm sure these little inclines will feel like mountains at the very end of the race!

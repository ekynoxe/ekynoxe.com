If you can&#8217;t find what you want to know about ruby percent notations ( %w, %q, %r, %x), then have a look over there:

Jim has obviously some other information sources than Google (where trying to search for %w is like trying to find your way in a dense steam room!)

The way to remember things is easy though:

*   %w is for **W**hite-spaced delimited arrays
*   %q works like **Q**uotes
*   %r wraps up nicely **R**egular expressions
*   %x simply e**X**ecutes system calls

Everywhere I now read "enjoy your off-season", "off-season training plans", "what to do and eat in the off-season" etc etc... Guess what? It's NOT the off-season for me yet!

<p class="attachement"><span><img src="{{ "ironman-703-weblogo.jpg" | image_path | cdn }}" alt="Ironman 70.3 Lanzarote" /></span></p>

In 3 weeks time, I'm racing the very first ironman 70.3 Lanzarote and it promises to be an absolute cracker of a race, potentially well suited to my strengths. Out of the three disciplines in triathlon, I'm the best at cycling, and with almost 1300m of elevation gain over 90Km, it should be a tough course in the wind and the heat of the volcanic island. Hopefully I can do my training and my supporters justice with a good race, and check out the place at the same time for next year's full ironman at the same place.

Off-season? Not yet...

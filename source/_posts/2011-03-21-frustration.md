There are many things that a designer/developer has to go through, with varying degrees of complexity and annoyance. We&#8217;ve all been there, all endured the pain of a browser not liking your latest CSS wizardry, servers crashing and a few late payments. It&#8217;s annoying, but except sometimes for this last one, we live!

However, for me, there is one thing that tops it all.

One thing that can make my blood boil in a few seconds of hearing the news: a completed project not published&#8230;

Now, if you work on a confidential project or a prototype, it may well be the case that you can&#8217;t show any of it. That&#8217;s fine, because you know it from day one.
But when a client does it all; goes through the whole process of producing a quality website; makes me sweat and prevents me from sleeping with late requests that I dutifully include for being professional and passionate; and in the end tells me: &#8220;it&#8217;s not going to be released, we&#8217;re just scrapping it&#8221;, then i&#8217;m not happy.

Ok I&#8217;ve been paid for my work (at least this client did pay&#8230;), but at the end of the day, my work is not out there to be shown, tested in real life and most importantly: used.
If you&#8217;re in a big agency, maybe it&#8217;s ok, maybe it&#8217;s part of it all. But if you are working on your own on the projects, then published work is your Â showcase.

I let you guess which site this one should have been for:

Thanks for your custom&#8230;

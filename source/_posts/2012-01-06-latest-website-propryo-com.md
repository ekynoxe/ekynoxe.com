<a title="Propryo.com" href="http://propryo.com/" target="_blank">Propryo</a> is a slight twist of the French word &#8220;proprio&#8221;, which means &#8220;home owner&#8221;. My sister is trying to explore a few business ideas and we built together this little website where home owners advertise their properties for sale. Propryo is nothing close to a trading platform, it&#8217;s only there to advertise properties in a simple way.

The latest addition to the properties for sale is the <a title="Villa Ã  Calvi (2A)" href="http://propryo.com/villa-calvi" target="_blank">Villa in Calvi</a> which is a great addition as a featured property!

<p class="attachement"><a href="{{ "propryo.png" | image_path | cdn }}" title="Propryo" rel="lightbox[892]"><img src="{{ "propryo_r500.png" | image_path | cdn }}" alt="Propryo" /></a></p>

For the techies, it should work on mobile browsers as well as desktops, having used a little bit of fluid and <a title="Responsive Web Design" href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/" target="_blank">responsive design</a> and built as a sinatra pure ruby application hosted on <a title="Heroku" href="http://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank">heroku</a>, using <a title="The Official YAML Web Site" href="http://www.yaml.org/" target="_blank">yaml</a> configuration files and photos hosted on <a title="Propryo on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/propryo" target="_blank">flickr</a>.

Any feedback appreciated!

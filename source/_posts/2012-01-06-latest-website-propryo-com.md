    title: Propryo
    summary: <p>Propryo is a slight twist of the French word “proprio”, which means “home owner”. My sister is trying to explore a few business ideas and we built together this little website where home owners advertise their properties for sale. Propryo is nothing close to a trading platform, it’s only there to advertise properties in a simple way. For the techies, it should work on mobile browsers as well as desktops, having used a little bit of fluid and responsive design and built as a sinatra pure ruby application hosted on heroku, using yaml configuration files and photos hosted on flickr.</p>

The latest addition to the properties for sale is the <a title="Villa à Calvi (2A)" href="http://propryo.com/villa-calvi" target="_blank">Villa in Calvi</a> which is a great addition as a featured property!

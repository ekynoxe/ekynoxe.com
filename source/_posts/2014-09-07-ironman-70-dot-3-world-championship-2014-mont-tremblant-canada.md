Having qualified more than 12 months prior to this race, a lot has had the time to happen in the mean time, and the focus of the 2014 season was initially on longer distance with [Ironman Lanzarote](/ironman-lanzarote-2014/) in May. Jo therefore updated my training plan to re-focus on more speed over the summer, with the intermediate "target" of [70.3 UK in Wimbleball](/ironman-70-dot-3-uk-2014/).

<p class="attachement"><a href="{{ "703_wc_31.jpg" | image_path | cdn }}" title="703_wc_31_r300.jpg" rel="lightbox[20140907_703_wc]"><img src="{{ "703_wc_31_r300.jpg" | image_path | cdn }}" alt="703_wc_31_r300.jpg" /></a></p>

For the 70.3 WC at the end of my season, I had no stress, no pressure, and, frankly, no real ambition. All I wanted was to enjoy the trip, the experience, and the race itself. I knew on the day I qualified that I wasn't going to go for a top spot. That wouldn't prevent me from giving it all, but I was just realistic about my abilities in that field.

For my first time at a World Championship event, I was ready to be amazed! I was ready to be welcomed as an elite athlete and soak it all up. Being with a few friends from [Black Line London][1] and [Team Freespeed][2] helped not feeling too lost without the usual support I get from my other half or my dad.

<!--more-->
The athlete's village and expo, however, was frankly rubbish, and not even worth mentioning. I guess manufacturers focus more on Kona, but that village felt even smaller than at other events. The organisation didn't seem like anything special, and I was gob-smacked to see that both transitions were going to be a "bags on the floor" affair! At a World Championship event!

At least having friends around made it all a nice experience and the days prior to the race were fantastic. The surroundings of Mt Tremblant are wild and very green. I'm not sure there's much to do in here other than be outdoors, and with nice roads like that, it was paradise to ride!

The few days before the race also brought some big doubts over my swim. While the weather was fine 2 days before the race (and it was fun to swim - quite far! - to find the "coffee boat") the day before the race was very windy. There was quite some swell (Yes! In a lake!), and having gone around the peninsula from the start to the end of the race swim course, I really didn't fancy going back. I eventually made it, trying to keep sight of speedy Roger and Jane, but that was a hard swim that I didn't enjoy!

It was all very calm on race morning, though, so all my fears had vanished. I just had to do what I usually do. The fog lifted right before the pros started, and I was in the first wave behind that, ready to be mauled, dunked and drowned by fast 'elite' swimmers.

<p class="attachement"><a href="{{ "-703_wc_04.jpg" | image_path | cdn }}" title="-703_wc_04_r300.jpg" rel="lightbox[20140907_703_wc]"><img src="{{ "-703_wc_04_r500.jpg" | image_path | cdn }}" alt="-703_wc_04_r300.jpg" /></a></p>

Fearing that I really wasn't to the level in the swim, I started on the left of the back row to avoid being in the scrum that was going to happen on the right where the buoys were. The scrum avoidance worked, but starting from the back was the wrong idea. Surprisingly, there were quite a few swimmers that looked a lot worse than me, and I had to navigate my way around a couple of packs that weren't moving fast at all. Very strange, and not what I had expected, but it was nice to be mid-pack out of the swim, having not seen to many athletes from the next waves pass by.

T1 was quite long, as you have to run all the way from the lake to the tents, and I'm pleased with getting around in roughly 5min, with about 1km of running, plus the usual kit-faffing antics.

I wasn't sure what to expect on the bike course. Having driven it at night, arriving a few days before, and only recced the very end, I didn't know what the long out and back was going to be. It was quite lumpy in places, but nothing hard, with very smooth roads, and only a little wind to start with.
After the balmy 20.4C water, though, the 10C air temperature was initially quite chilly, but that strangely didn't hinder me at all. It was my first outing in the fantastic Fusion speed-suit, and it seems that it worked quite well.

But if the course wasn't a problem, some of the other athletes definitely were. Never have I seen so much drafting in a race. I guess the waves starts format and the relatively comparable speed of people in the swim was always going to make it hard to find some clear road. But some packs of what looked like more than 50 riders weren't even trying not to draft. Disgraceful attitude, drafting and blocking everywhere with little, if any, enforcement. I think the pros did complain about it as well...
I could understand if, sometimes, at other events, people didn't really get the drafting rules, but not at an event you had to qualify for. There's simply no excuse.

I managed to break free of one pack at some point, but the second time, it didn't work. 50 guys in a f**** pack are always going to be faster than you, no matter what. So I let them pass and - with others - complained a few times to marshals on motorbikes coming in the other direction.
Eventually one Marshall came around and carded about 10 guys in one go, but the situation was ridiculous. At a WC event, this shouldn't happen!

After I got to grips with letting the big packs go, I managed to concentrate on my own race and tried to put some Watts down. I didn't really feel like I had much - possibly due to the cold temperature at the start - but the overall numbers weren't too bad with a 218W NP. A bit under what I had expected, but with a 2h24' bike, I can say I'm quite pleased!

The last 20K of the ride were quite hilly, and I knew it, having ridden it a few days before, but it felt a lot harder than on that training ride. I still passed a lot of the heavy muscle guys (as usual), only for them to pass me again on the way down.

Usual stuff, really, but pretty swiftly into T2! This one was pretty quick, giving the bike to a handler and only having to pick-up a bag on the floor.

I felt good on the run, and maintained my pace even over the lumps, which I was very happy with. By now, I knew the course like the back of my hand as my accommodation was almost at the turnaround point. I knew where I should hold off a little and where I could push, which helped a lot. That course is definitely not easy! The way into town for example, with the massive climb right at the end of the lap, is pretty steep!

I was looking around to see if I could recognise faces during the run, and the only pro I managed to recognise was Sebastian Kienle, who didn't look too good at the time.
Matt Molloy and Roger Barr were obviously pushing hard, but they managed a sign, which was nice in that crazy crowd!

Other than this, the run was almost a best, only because of a loo stop 2/3 in as I had the trot all week. But otherwise the nutrition seemed to have worked well. It hadn't been too hot on the bike, so I didn't drink all my gels, and in retrospect, it was probably wise, so to avoid further 'damage' on the run

I wanted to enjoy my finish, but I almost got knocked over the barriers by an idiot who shoved me aside in the finish chute. Being so far down the rankings, that was just stupid and pointless.

Overall, that race was great. The course was very fast despite the lumps, and if it wasn't that far from Europe, I'd certainly go back there!

On the whole, the venue was fantastic, and the race challenging enough. So from a "holiday" point of view, it was a great trip. Race-wise, however, except for the draft-fest, there was really nothing extra or new that I didn't already experience at other races around the world, so that wasn't anything special.

Good PB though! Thank you Canada and the people of Mt Tremblant.

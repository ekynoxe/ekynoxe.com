After creating [rewriter][1] I received a request at work asking if there was a simple way to test errors views on the front-end code we do at Betfair. As I did not have any real idea at the time, I wrote a dead simple ruby application hosted on my machine to return an HTTP error code, so the front-end would display the correct error messages. It seemed it was a good idea and I improved it by creating [kodes][2].

Kodes is a simple pure ruby application running on

<a href="http://ekx.im/e" target="_blank">Sinatra</a> and hosted, once again on <a href="http://ekx.im/U" target="_blank">heroku</a>. As it says on the tin: *kodes is a simple service that allows you to test that your applications handle HTTP response codes properly.*

So all you have to do is to send a request to http://kodes.ekynoxe.com/k/**&lt;your-code&gt;** and it \*should\* return the corresponding HTTP status code in the response, along with a description of the code itself, as per the HTTP/1.1 specifications.

Now, I say \*should\* because some status codes like the 1xx family simply instruct browsers to keep going with a request. All browsers should comply with this and not do anything until another response like a 2xx or 4xx is received. The bad news is that you won&#8217;t see a snazzy description page like this one for the <a href="http://kodes.ekynoxe.com/k/306" target="_blank">306 code</a> (unused!), but if you use curl (or any other http request library that is NOT a browser), you should see the response with the correct status code:

<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate" title="">$ curl -0v http://kodes.ekynoxe.com/k/306
</pre>

Also, the code is hosted on github at <a href="http://ekx.im/a7" target="_blank">https://github.com/ekynoxe/kodes</a>

I hope this is as helpful to you that it is to our teams of developers here! Enjoy.

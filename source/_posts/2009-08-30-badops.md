Badops is slowly arrive to maturity as an online tool to report bad behaving radio operators.  
The brief for this project was that simple:

*   Total freedom on the design
*   Simplicity of the interface for only a few functions
*   ability to integrate later design and functionality requirements

In other words, a perfect project for me!  
Especially on the design part, the total freedom allowed me to get down to something refreshing. A bit on the flashy side, I admit, but hey, the goal is to nail these bad-ops!

Work is still going on as requirements are coming in, but there is plenty of room to add more content on that website.

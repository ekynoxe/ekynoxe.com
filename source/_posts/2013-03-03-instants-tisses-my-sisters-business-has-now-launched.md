    summary: <p>Marrying high quality printed paper and light fabrics is the core of my sister's business. While she took care of the graphics design under my guidance to make it translate well on the web (she's a print and clothe designer), I took care of creating the online store using Shopify as the underlying platform. Plenty of Javascript development and minute details were required on the site, but hopefully this transmits well what she offers.</p>

Several months in the making to sort out all the details and go around the inevitable changes of mind that my sister always goes through, her business online store, [Instants Tissés][1], is now open!

&#8220;Instants Tissés&#8221; is French for &#8220;Woven instants&#8221;, and her business is all about special occasion cards and paper supports with a twist: fabric! Marrying high quality printed paper and light fabrics should bring an extra personal touch to your special occasions. At the moment she has an extensive collection of [wedding][2] invitations, menus, dinner table plans and cards, but a [birth][3] section is coming as well.

And if you don&#8217;t find anything that really tickles your fancy in the large existing collection, there is also a &#8220;[custom][4]&#8221; service that should let you get a quote on your ideal, personalised support for your special occasions.

Do pay her store a visit, use google translate if you don&#8217;t understand French, and do buy some of her stuff! She&#8217;s getting started and needs all the support she can get!

For the techies of you who read this, her site has been done using the excellent [Shopify][5] with a completely custom theme.

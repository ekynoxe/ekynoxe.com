Several months in the making to sort out all the details and go around the inevitable changes of mind that my sister always goes through, her business online store, [Instants Tissés][1], is now open!

<p class="attachement"><a href="http://blog.ekynoxe.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/logo_IT.png" rel="lightbox[6103]" title="Instants Tissés"><img src="http://blog.ekynoxe.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/logo_IT-300x127.png" alt="Instants Tissés" /></a></p>

&#8220;Instants Tissés&#8221; is French for &#8220;Woven instants&#8221;, and her business is all about special occasion cards and paper supports with a twist: fabric! Marrying high quality printed paper and light fabrics should bring an extra personal touch to your special occasions. At the moment she has an extensive collection of [wedding][2] invitations, menus, dinner table plans and cards, but a [birth][3] section is coming as well.

And if you don&#8217;t find anything that really tickles your fancy in the large existing collection, there is also a &#8220;[custom][4]&#8221; service that should let you get a quote on your ideal, personalised support for your special occasions.

Do pay her store a visit, use google translate if you don&#8217;t understand French, and do buy some of her stuff! She&#8217;s getting started and needs all the support she can get!

For the techies of you who read this, her site has been done using the excellent [Shopify][5] with a completely custom theme.

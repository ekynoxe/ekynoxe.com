I&#8217;ve added a nice image to my little HTTP status codes application for the famous &#8220;teapot&#8221; 418 code ([http://kodes.ekynoxe.com/k/418][1]), but I couldn&#8217;t find any credit for that image anywhere.

**Is this image your work? Let me know so I can credit you!!!**

<p class="attachement"><a href="{{ "talk_to_the_teapot.jpg" | image_path | cdn }}" title="Is this image your work? Let me know so I can credit you!!!" rel="lightbox[909]"><img src="{{ "talk_to_the_teapot_r500.jpg" | image_path | cdn }}" alt="Is this image your work? Let me know so I can credit you!!!" /></a></p>

Given the emphasis given these days to credit attribution and piracy, I&#8217;m wondering how you can trace an image source&#8230; Anyone knows?

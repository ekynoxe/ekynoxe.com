I&#8217;ve added a nice image to my little HTTP status codes application for the famous &#8220;teapot&#8221; 418 code ([http://kodes.ekynoxe.com/k/418][1]), but I couldn&#8217;t find any credit for that image anywhere.

**Is this image your work? Let me know so I can credit you!!!**
<p class="attachement"><a href="http://blog.ekynoxe.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/talk_to_the_teapot.jpg" title="talk to the teapot" rel="lightbox[909]"><img src="http://blog.ekynoxe.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/talk_to_the_teapot-300x193.jpg" alt="Is this image your work? Let me know so I can credit you!!!"  /></a></p>

Given the emphasis given these days to credit attribution and piracy, I&#8217;m wondering how you can trace an image source&#8230; Anyone knows?

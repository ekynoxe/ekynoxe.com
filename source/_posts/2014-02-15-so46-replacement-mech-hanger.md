Last week I stupidly fell with my in the corridor at home. The new floor is some kind of plastic tilling that makes walking with cleats extremely slipper. Long story short: I fell ON my bike, with a backpack, and in the process bent and cracked the mech hanger on my Old Focus Variado 2007.

This is an old bike, and like with many old things, finding parts is close to impossible. The hanger reference I needed is SO46, but I couldn't find it anywhere on-line, and even the manufacturer in US sent me back to [Wheels Manufacturing Inc.](http://wheelsmfg.com/derailleur-hanger-42.html) to check if they could help me. Unfortunately, I had no luck anywhere.

Looking at several models on-line, I found a few close matches and ordered three, including one supposedly for Bianchi bikes that looked very close. Funny enough, it's a Evans that I found what I needed, and the only one who had them in stock!

None of the three were a perfect fit straight away. Both the [Bianchi](http://www.evanscycles.com/products/bianchi/hanger-01-02-ec009107) or the [WMFG 41](http://wheelsmfg.com/derailleur-hanger-41.html) needed their top to be milled to properly align the bolt hole with the frame, while the [WMFG 42](http://wheelsmfg.com/derailleur-hanger-42.html) "only" needed the ridge to be removed. While the Bianchi seemed overall a closer fit, it also seemed weaker than the other two, so I elected to take the ridge out of the WMFG42. I took about 10 minutes with a mini drill, a cutting disc and some milling heads, but it went on without much of a problem.

So if you have a bike that needs a hanger reference SO46, you can use a [Wheels MFG #42](http://wheelsmfg.com/derailleur-hanger-42.html) and remove the ridge. I'm posting this here because I know that if I break it again, I'll have a place to look back for clues as to which one to get!

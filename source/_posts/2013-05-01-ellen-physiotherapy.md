    summary: <p>A simple yet effective single page layout to launch Ellen's business as as self employed physiotherapist in the South West London area. Ellen had some initial ideas so this made the design phase quite quick. The logo was done from her original ideas that I have adapted, and we have also created business cards to go with the website. I used a pure ruby application using sinatra for this small site to make it fast and easy to develop.</p>

Ellen needed a simple yet effective single page layout to launch her business as as self employed physiotherapist in the South West London area.

She had some initial ideas so this made the design phase quite quick. The logo was done from her original ideas that I have adapted.

<p class="attachement"><a href="http://www.physioellen.co.uk/" title="Ellen Physiotherapy"><img src="{{ "logo_ellen.png" | image_path | cdn }}" alt="Ellen Physiotherapy" /></a></p>

We have also created business cards to go with the website using the wonderful [Moo luxe cards](http://uk.moo.com/products/luxe/business-cards.html)

As there was no requirement to quickly update the site, I simply used a pure ruby application using sinatra. This makes this small site very fast and as her partner, easy to update for me!

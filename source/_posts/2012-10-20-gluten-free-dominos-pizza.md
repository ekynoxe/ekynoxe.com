Gluten-free Domino’s Pizza
=========================

![Dominos Pizza Logo](/assets/img/dom-logo.jpg)

On November 5th, Domino’s UK will start stocking a gluten-free pizza base. The
10 inch crust has been available in the US for the majority of the year and has
largely been a success. As a result, they're rolling it out on this side of the
Atlantic too.

However, unlike the US pizza base, the UK one is _suitable for sufferers of Coeliac Disease_. The difference is that Domino’s US use a wheat and corn flour mix to work their dough, whereas here in the UK they're only using corn flour.

This is great news indeed, and something that Domino’s UK are clearly taking some pride in since they presented the new bases at the UK Coeliac Society AGM recently.

I don't know about you, but I've missed fast-food-style pizza since the day I was diagnosed with Coeliac Disease. Whilst I've made do with a multitude of gluten-free pizza bases (both on prescription and bought from shops), home-made pizza tastes nothing like Domino's or any other high-street pizza restaurant. (It's probably worth noting that a very good Italian friend of mine thinks Domino's have quite the nerve in calling their products "pizza" and that I'm not really missing out.)

Needless to say; stay tuned for a review of the pizza once it's on sale.

Today there's a bit of everything early morning. 15 min swim, a quick spin on the bike around Puerto del Carmen and a little run. Stretching the legs and re-invigorating the body. Then it's time to play with lots of sticky numbers on bags, helmet, forehead of my dad (well, maybe not this one, but there are some if you want them!)
Everything's ready in a flash, and as usual I can't find anything else to do. Boring times, just waiting. A nap. Then going to rack the bike and put the bags in place.

There's as usual a lot of money on the racks there! And lots of testosterone pumping! Some look properly scared, and some even comment they don't like the wind... 3 of 'them' will be doing their first ever triathlon tomorrow! I hope they've trained a bit at least! Sounds like a dare gone wrong, but I wish them all the best.

The bike is racked in possibly the worst place in transition, between a fire hydrant and a concrete bin that I'll have to get around, but the race will happen somewhere else. Keeping a smile on my face, I'm here to have fun!

Number 411, ready to go...

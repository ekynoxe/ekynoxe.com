Wednesday only has a little swim and a 90min spin on the bike. I do half a lap of the swim course, practice a few more times diving back in. It's a bit better today! The hotel on the sea front is an easy sight as well to get your bearings.

Then on the bike straight afterwards to check the first part of the course. It's windy, there's lots of traffic, and I can't go slow or spin easy most of the time. On the tailwind sections, there's no point using the brakes, and on the uphills, which incidentally had a head wind as well, I've got to push my watts in my lowest gear to keep climbing at 14kph. Fun!! I feel great though, and I make it to the randez-vous with my dad at the Yaiza roundabout in 50min. So much faster than expected. That's the first "climb" of the route covered. On race day, it will be all about pacing that one, as it will be so easy to overcook it right here at the start! Unlike in the UK, there are very few passages where the road itself makes you slow down! So I'll have to keep an eye on HR and power here. There will be plenty of opportunities later on to open it up a little more anyway, whether by choice or not.

That's the workout for the day done. We go to registration to avoid the brawl tomorrow, receive a black wristband. I'm tied in! That's it now! Only things left to do are to change the bike tires for the proper race ones, have a nap, and eat more.

Thursday is a day of nothing! And doing nothing is BORING! Things will resume tomorrow but for now I'm keeping to the plan! A good night sleep, a big breakfast, some work on the computer with yet more fighting to get internet working, and crossing the island for the race briefing. Impressive to have Mr Gordon Haller racing Saturday! He's the first winner of Ironman back in 1978! And the guy looks fit! Very fit for a 60+ YO!
Most of the dangerous roads will be closed, and that's great news! The El Golfo and the climb to Mirador del Rio with the switchback roads on the way down will be free from traffic other than race officials, and the long straight through Timanfaya National park will be closed in the direction of the race. Great!

Now off for dinner and an early night. I'm unlikely to sleep well Friday night and I have to wake up early anyway...

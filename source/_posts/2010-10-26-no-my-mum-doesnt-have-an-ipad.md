It&#8217;s kind of crazy sometimes to work in an industry where everything is media, emails, posts, tweets, pings, poke and feeds. However, what many &#8211; including myself until recently &#8211; do not realise, is that we are all surrounded by a lot more people that have no idea what twitter is and can&#8217;t care less for facebook or the latest crazy app on iPhone.

A good example of this is my mum. She uses internet to check her emails like twice a week, go to gardening websites and sometimes pushes it and buys something online. But one thing my mum doesn&#8217;t understand &#8211; and doesn&#8217;t need at all &#8211; is that the crazy developer community that we are can communicate in less than 140 characters, text messages or through posts on a &#8220;wall&#8221;.

No, my mum doesn&#8217;t have an iPad. She has a phone, with buttons, I can hear her voice, and it&#8217;s great that way!

Use your phone.

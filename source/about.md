About Timbo's Kitchen
=====================

This is a blog about food and cooking. More than that, it is my personal
collection of recipes archived in one place so I don't have to keep trawling
through my recipe and scrap books.

I learnt to cook from an early age, and because my sister and father both
suffer from Coeliac Disease, _all the recipes were gluten-free by design_. My
mother is an excellent gluten-free cook and from her I picked up a great
passion for food and cookery.

Having been diagnosed with Coeliac Disease in my late 20s (it is genetic,
after all), my passion for cookery took on a new fervour as I realised that
pretty much all gluten-free cook books are full of nothing but inventive salads
and just about every rice dish a cook can come up with. Whilst that's all well
and good, sometimes we all like a bit of comfort food or something just plain
indulgent. A gluten-free diet does not prevent this, it just means we have to
be more selective of our choices.

Eating gluten-free is not difficult, nor is it particularly limiting. The
recipes in this blog are meant for everyone, not just those requiring a
gluten-free diet. Hopefully it will serve to prove that gluten-free is not just
a "faddy" diet, or a sentence to survive on tasteless boring foods, but simply
an easy to live with alternative to the modern cereal-rich diet.

As a final disclaimer, this blog may contain the odd inventive salad and some
rice dishes—but only because I like them…

As both are different in the DB, this works well.\n\nAlso, admitting that both solutions would use the same single_access_token, resetting it only for one format would lead to strange results, and an inconsistent behavior for the user.\n\nNow, if you want to access a website both on a web desktop and lets say on a web mobile, for sure, there will be a problem with my solution, but my guess is this will not happen often.","comment_parent":"0","replies":[]},{"id":"2547","comment_date":"2011-06-16 13:25:04","comment_date_gmt":"2011-06-16 12:25:04","comment_author":"Matt","comment_author_email":"matt@ekynoxe.com","comment_author_url":"http://ekynoxe.com","comment_content":"Hi Chris, appologies for the delay in coming back to you.\nI have now updated the code above with things to add in the application controller.\n\nbasically, I created a helper method in there and registered it with the helper_method call at the top of my application controller.\n\nThe code is below, and assumes you've got a named login route.

This is a git hook, so it should work on any git install providing that you modify the script to use the correct file system.\n\nYou can also write the same script in pretty much any language the shell of said server can interpret. This is bash, but you could use ruby and others.\n\nYou can find a more advanced script doign something else here: http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-An-Example-Git-Enforced-Policy\n\nb)\nThere is nothing that would prevent you from building a more complex script, checking what branch you are pushing to and deploying the right code to the right staging, integration, live etc servers. Just bare in mind that this particular hook above is only intended to work on the same machine than the repository is.\nBut because these hooks are essentially scripts, you can do whatever you want in them, even stuff completely unrelated to git itslef, like sending an email to all your team telling them you've pushed code etc.\n\nI don't have example of such scripts handy, but that's essentially how heroku or openshift work. The sharing/collaboration is the pure git branch part, the push-publish is in the hooks.\n\nI don't think the limitation will be in the repo here, but in how complex your hooks and management system will be.","comment_parent":"0","replies":[]},{"id":"28424","comment_date":"2013-08-22 19:55:47","comment_date_gmt":"2013-08-22 18:55:47","comment_author":"Vincent","comment_author_email":"vincent@bigsweaterdesign.com","comment_author_url":"http://bigsweaterdesign.com","comment_content":"This worked perfectly for me.

What I'm criticising is the fact that customers have absolutely no way to make their rights valued.\n\nIn this case, the boat was late, as it has been many more times than is acceptable to deem them providing a good service on that particular line this summer. How is this acceptable?\n\nIf you never had a problem all these years, my guess is that you never tried to cross on foot or with a bike the last two years. Late arrivals, no time for turnaround and industrial actions have plagued the crossings. I lost count of how many people told me about being stuck on the other side, or missing connections and having to re-book tickets because their boats were late.\n\nThe staff on board is doing what it can and has always been nice. You seemed to have missed that too in my previous letter to them. They're just stretching it too far, and that's why it fails.\n\nMaybe I was unlucky to be on those crossings, but their customer service is just getting away lightly with recurring \"sorry for the inconvenience\" for my liking.\n\nEnjoy your crossings!","comment_parent":"0","replies":[]}]},"2012-09-06-the-only-good-cyclist-is-a-dead-one-editor-of-the-richmond-magazine-september-issue":{"slug":"2012-09-06-the-only-good-cyclist-is-a-dead-one-editor-of-the-richmond-magazine-september-issue","comments":[{"id":"11459","comment_date":"2012-09-06 10:37:31","comment_date_gmt":"2012-09-06 09:37:31","comment_author":"Matt","comment_author_email":"matt@ekynoxe.com","comment_author_url":"http://ekynoxe.com","comment_content":"Thanks Gavin, I've updated the post.","comment_parent":"0","replies":[]},{"id":"11457","comment_date":"2012-09-06 10:35:08","comment_date_gmt":"2012-09-06 09:35:08","comment_author":"Gavin","comment_author_email":"gspurling@gmail.com","comment_author_url":"","comment_content":"Just noticed you have the wrong Facebook link - should be https://www.facebook.com/Sheengate","comment_parent":"0","replies":[]}]},"2012-09-07-gorilla-signage":{"slug":"2012-09-07-gorilla-signage","comments":[{"id":"11661","comment_date":"2012-09-13 09:15:24","comment_date_gmt":"2012-09-13 08:15:24","comment_author":"IvanDM","comment_author_email":"detronizator@gmail.com","comment_author_url":"http://blog.ivandemarino.me","comment_content":"I know that the people that had this idea has to stay \"secret\" because they would at least prosecute him/her/them.\n\nBut it's such a GENIUS thing and so well executed, they have my respect for life :)","comment_parent":"0","replies":[]}]},"2012-09-06-clarifications-on-the-richmond-magazine":{"slug":"2012-09-06-clarifications-on-the-richmond-magazine","comments":[{"id":"11663","comment_date":"2012-09-13 09:35:26","comment_date_gmt":"2012-09-13 08:35:26","comment_author":"IvanDM","comment_author_email":"detronizator@gmail.com","comment_author_url":"http://blog.ivandemarino.me","comment_content":"You know me, and you know how I feel about dickheads.\nThis guy is one.\nAnd he deserves to lose his job.\n\nCyclist die in car accidents caused by cyclist and/or cars.\nCars get scratched by a accidents caused by cyclists.

That is real heroism.\n\nWhile I do respect the sports men/women that do set amazing goal and work towards them, if those goals are \"personal challenges\", I can't see them as heroes. They are doing it for themselves.\n\nI know this was not your main point here, but here comes mine.\n\nAthletes that do what they do for money, fame and \"need to be better than anyone else\" are not only NOT HEROES, they are actually mean bastards.

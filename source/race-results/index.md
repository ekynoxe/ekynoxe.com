## 2015

### [Wokingham half marathon](/wokingham-half-marathon-2015/) &#8211; 07 February 2015

A very leisurly run witn Carel to pace him on a long training run for his ultra-training.

**1h43'20"**

### [The Iceman off-road duathlon](/the-iceman-off-road-duathlon-2015/) &#8211; 07 February 2015

## 2014

### The Wildman off-road duathlon &#8211; 22 Novembre 2014

**2h27'03" (43th overall, 9th in age group / 28)**

That felt a lot harder than last year on the bike. Having not ridden the MTB at all before the race, it was always going to be hard. Sticky mud and wrong tires didn't make it any easier, but the overall result was faster with a few higher places up the rankings!

### Ironman 70.3 World Championship - Mt Tremblant, Canada &#8211; 09 Septembre 2014

**4h35'10" (484th overall, 101th in age group)**

A nice trip in a wonderfully quiet place, and a fantastic race result. I was never going to be a contender so I focused on doing the best I could and bagged myself a fantastic PB, including having ran the whole half marathon.
That was all a bit shadowed by the un-sanctioned massive draft-fest on the bike. I don't understand how an event of this calibre lets this sort of thing happen, and how athletes keep on cheating like that at this level.
But anyway, World champs finisher with a new half iron PB!

### [Thorpe park sprint triahtlon](/thorpe-park-sprint-triathlon-2014/) &#8211; 21 Septembre 2014

**1h06'16" (6th overall, 1st in age group)**

Wanting to have a real go at this one after last year's 4th place overall. I had a "normal" swim for me, being, like last year, in front of the second pack, but nothing stellar. The bike went alright and I made progress, but the run is where I wanted to nail it, and I got a 5K and a sprint tri PB for the efforts! Only 6th, but first in M30-40! No prize for that sadly, so I'll have to wait before climbing on a podium!

### [Ironman 70.3 UK](/ironman-70-dot-3-uk-2014/) &#8211; 15 June 2014

**5h10'10" (53rd overall, 47th male and 15th in age group)**

No pressure race for me since qualifying for Mt Tremblant at Lanza 70.3 last year.
First wave, front of the pack start, for the most civilised swim I've ever had in a 70.3 before hitting the brutal part of the race. 23rd out of the water. Surpriiise!!!
Not a flat section on the bike course, barely getting over THE hill on a 39x27, and more ascent than Lanza 70.3: that course packs a punch! 9th after the bike... This is going well!
Nevermind the bike, the run's worse! A bit down mentally in the first lap, I regained conciousness for the last two. I didn't manage to sprint for the line but that was still enough for a good time. So happy days!

**10h21'18" (121th overall, 114th male and 21st in age group)**

Slow swim, stronger winds, too many stops on the run. Good result, but not what I wanted.

### The Trailman off road duathlon &#8211; 22 February
**Cancelled due to flooding.** Well, delayed, but I won't be in the UK on the new race date of 15 March :-(

### Wokingham half marathon &#8211; 9 February

**Cancelled due to flooding**
I replaced it with 2 fast laps of Richmond park with the Black Line London guys. It was very windy and cold, but I managed a respectable 1h37' for the two laps, with a 1/2 marathon split of just under 1h30'.
For the terrain and the weather, I'll take it!!

* Richmond park 2 laps &#8211; 23K: 1h37'29" [garmin data][77]

### [The Iceman off road duathlon](/2014-iceman-off-road-duathlon/) &#8211; 25 January

**2h19'14" (20th overall, 18th male and 6th in M30-34)**

Easier overall than the Mudman, but no ice, and a lot more mud! I started mid-pack on the first run but made good progress through it, then had a blast on the bike and felt a lot more powerful (thanks to a lot of turbo trainer work for the big races later this year) and left T2 in around 25th place! I kept picking up places on the second run and finished 20th overall. Nutrition seems to have worked ok, and although still tired from a hard training week, I had a good race.

## 2013

### [The Mudman off road duathlon](/2013-mudman-off-road-duathlon/) &#8211; 7 November

**2h14'53" (36th overall, 33rd male and 7th in M30-34)**

A technically more demanding course than the Wildman, but a specially brutal loop repeated 5 times across both runs and bike leg. Probably the hardest of the Off road series. I started off the front, while still being conservative in my efforts to not blow up on the second run, and although I couldn't climb everything on the bike, I had a good time. The cold water on the bike and second run was a good wake up call, and I managed to sprint for the line trying to catch one last rival before the end. Second run was 20s faster than the first one, so on even par, and no stopping this time!

*   Run 1 &#8211; 7.5K: 36'43" [run 1 data][71]

### Perivale 5 miles road run

**5miles &#8211; 30'02" (29 / 349) [garmin data][1]**

Super fast course on pavements and in Perivale park. I couldn't catch the Santa who finished 3rd&#8230; Lots of D3 friends to cheer on. Legs a little tight after yesterday's Grim challenge, but managed a fantastic time.

### The Grim Challenge &#8211; 30 November

**8miles &#8211; 58'43" (74th / 2555) [garmin data][2]**

Held on army training grounds, that was a fun race in mud, on lose gravel and in massive and deep trenches filled with very cold water, some chest high! Started at the back but picked my way up as I could and finished strong.

### [The Wildman off road duathlon](/2013-wildman-off-road-duathlon/) &#8211; 16 November

**2h27'03" (50th overall, 12th in age group / 39)**

First off road race, never ridden a proper MTB course before and only had about 70K on the MTB coming in this race. It was all about fun. Boy it was hard! First run went alright, possibly started too far back, but completed it ok. The bike was a lot harder than expected. Getting passed by guys at ridiculous speeds on technical portions, took a tumble in one of the descent and drink powder clogged up the bottle. Last run was pure evil. Cramping heavily with 2K to go up a very steep hill and couldn't move for a little bit. But happy to finish this one!

### Hillingdon Autumn Duathlon &#8211; 10 November

**45'05" (15th overall, 11th in age group)**

Very fast opening first run straight into the red zone. It took me a while to settle into the bike (on road bike) and it felt hard. I've also been a muppet in that I did 11 laps instead of 10. A great shame as I was apparently second passing transition before doing the extra lap. The last run was hard, managing cramps that were just about to come out hard. Duathlon is hard! Especially sprint work on the back of 5 weeks of doing almost nothing.

*   Run 1 + T1 &#8211; 2 miles: 11'22" [run 1 + T1 data][8]
*   Bike + T2 &#8211; 10 miles: 27'52" [bike data][9]
*   Run 2 &#8211; 1 mile: 5'48" [run 2 data][10]

*&#8212; End of season break of 5 weeks without training &#8212;*

### [Ironman 70.3 Lanzarote](/lanzarote-70-3-2013-hot-windy-hard-yet-the-perfect-end/) &#8211; 05 October

**4h58'53" (50th overall, 10th in age group)**

12min PB from last year despite a bike with plenty of cramping. Great swim right on the 30min mark, and run not too bad either managing the legs alright. All goals achieved (sub 5h and top 10) plus the icing on the cake with qualification to the 70.3 WC in Mr Tremblant next year!

*   Swim 1.9K: 30'09" [swim data][11]

### [Thorpe park sprint triathlon](/thorpe-park-sprint-triathlon/) &#8211; 22nd September

Replacing the original Big Cow Events club relays that got cancelled because of blue algae and subsequent numbers of cancellations.

**1h07'21" (4th overall, 2nd in age group)**

PB in every leg and overall, and this time, transitions went almost well! A bit apprehensive since my last sprint race was more than a year ago, but transitions with kit, especially  T1, were what I wanted to nail and I did. I tried a short sleeve layer under my tri top and it worked to keep warm, was not impacting my swim and kept me toasty on the bike. It was unnecessary, but I had to try for the benefit of other races in the future. Swim time was roughly what I can do now, without being stellar. It was very weedy and a lot colder than expected! I pushed hard on the bike and almost got 40kph average (39.6), but I removed my feet out of my shoes way too early. T2 was good, and I spent very little time to put on my socks and get rid of my helmet, but as an idiot I went the wrong way to go out the transition area! The run was spent chasing down Matthew who started in the wave 10min before me but I ran out of road, still posting a 5K PB. Good little race to blow out the cobwebs before the last big one of the season in two weeks!

*   Swim 750m: 12'37" [swim data][16]
*   T1: 1'04" [T1 data][17]

### [Ironman 70.3 Zell Am See](/ironman-70-3-zell-am-see-2013-the-wet-one/) &#8211; 01 Septembre

**4h39'41" (139th overall, 126th male and 31th in age group)**

PB in every leg and overall, but bad transitions yet again. T1 being cold and trying to put arm warmers on wet arms, T2 because of stuck bike shoes cable. I've had an OK swim pretty much all in clear water. On the bike, I couldn't get to my target power, probably because of the water/cold. Run felt alright except for some lower back pain for the first half, and an epic fail with 3K to go with jelly legs going away from under me. Nevertheless, a PB race result, and not far off (in time) from the top 15/20.

### [The New Forest Swashbuckler](/the-swashbuckler-2013-finally-incident-free/) &#8211; 02 June 2013

**4h43'00" (39th overall, 20th in age group)**

Average swim, took my time in T1 to put on all layers properly. Pushed hard on the bike to see what would that do, and took a few breaks at aid stations on the run. Finally a Swashbuckler race completed without incident!
